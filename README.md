This repo is for TCG-LLM: Physics-aware Fine-tuning with Quality-based Reward Shaping for Tropical Cyclogenesis Detection and Localization
## Introduction
In this paper, we propose the ** Tropical CycloGenesis Large Language Model (TCG-LLM)**, a multimodal large language model for basin-scale TCG detection and localization. We design a physics-aware fine-tuning strategy, using encoders based on convolutional neural networks to extract TC-specific physically meaningful features, which are injected in VLMs to guide the model to incorporate meteorological knowledge in fine-tuning. To improve generalization beyond training patterns, we further incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with quality-based reward shaping, using an online-learned quality function to provide dense intermediate learning signals that accelerate convergence and improve accuracy. We also apply fine-grained penalty on false negative cases to reduce miss TCG detections. We construct the \textbf{Tropical Cyclogenesis Detection and Location Dataset (TCDLD)} for evaluation. Experiments show that TCG-LLM reduces TC detection mean absolute error and localization mean distance error by 40.87\% and 31.2\%, respectively, compared with state-of-the-art baselines.
