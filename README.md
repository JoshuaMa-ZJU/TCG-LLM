This repo is for the paper TCG-LLM: Physics-aware Fine-tuning with Quality-based Reward Shaping for Tropical Cyclogenesis Detection and Localization
## Introduction
In this paper, we propose the ***Tropical CycloGenesis Large Language Model (TCG-LLM)***, a multimodal large language model for basin-scale TCG detection and localization. We design a physics-aware fine-tuning strategy, using encoders based on convolutional neural networks to extract TC-specific physically meaningful features, which are injected in VLMs to guide the model to incorporate meteorological knowledge in fine-tuning. To improve generalization beyond training patterns, we further incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with quality-based reward shaping, using an online-learned quality function to provide dense intermediate learning signals that accelerate convergence and improve accuracy. We also apply fine-grained penalty on false negative cases to reduce miss TCG detections. We construct the ***Tropical Cyclogenesis Detection and Location Dataset (TCDLD)*** for evaluation. Experiments show that TCG-LLM reduces TC detection mean absolute error and localization mean distance error by 40.87% and 31.2%, respectively, compared with state-of-the-art baselines.
## Framework

  The input of TCG-LLM consists of two parts: prompts and data, where the data component includes satellite images, geopotential height (GPH) data and sea surcface temperature (SST) data covering an entire ocean basin. For each type of data, we generate textual statistical descriptors and feed them to the VLM together with the corresponding images. We incorporate TC knowledge and design Image Encoder, GPH Encoder, and SST Encoder based on CNNs and attention mechanisms to extract visual physics-aware features. For the corresponding statistical descriptors, we design a Text Encoder to capture semantic information, and fuse textual and visual features via cross-attention, enabling the model to focus on image regions relevant to the text and improving visual understanding.   
  
  The VLM prompts consist of four components: (1) a system prompt that introduces the overall task, (2) a task description prompt that specifies the TCG detection and localization objective, (3) a chain-of-thought (CoT) prompt that encourages decomposing complex problems into intermediate steps to improve the accuracy and stability of multi-step reasoning, and (4) a format-constraint prompt that specifies the output formats to facilitate downstream parsing and evaluation.  
  
  The fine-tuning of TCG-LLM proceeds in two stages. First, we apply SFT to the VLM using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) PEFT. To incorporate TC physics during adaptation, we propose a physics-aware fine-tuning strategy that injects the CNN-encoder feature vectors into the self-attention computation, allowing the LLM to leverage physically informative representations throughout fine-tuning. Second, we further perform RL fine-tuning using GRPO. We adopt quality-based fine-grained reward shaping by augmenting the reward with an online-learned quality function, which provides intermediate signals that reflect the improvement of the current state, helping the model identify the direction and magnitude of updates more effectively and learn better strategies.
